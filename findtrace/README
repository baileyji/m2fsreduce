How to run FINDTRACE.PRO

Currently, findtrace requires a structure to be input with FILENAME, HEADER, FLUX,
ERR and MASK tags.  That structure can be easily be created or the program can also
be easily changed.  Run it like this:

fits_read,'r0104.fits',im,head
str={filename:'r0104.fits',header:head,flux:float(im),err:sqrt(float(im>1)),mask:long(im*0)}
findtrace,str,tracestr,dcr=4,halfwid=8,npts=40

The output is the TRACESTR structure with one element per order.  It looks like this:

IDL> help,/st,tracestr
** Structure <18d9608>, 15 tags, length=184, data length=174, refs=1:
   PEAKY           FLOAT           1775.00
   WTY             FLOAT           0.00000
   GAUSSY          FLOAT           1774.97
   FWHM            FLOAT           7.40444
   HEIGHT          FLOAT           2458.71
   GCOEF           FLOAT     Array[3]
   FITCOEF         DOUBLE    Array[5]
   SIGCOEF         DOUBLE    Array[5]
   RMS             FLOAT         0.0873235
   CHISQ           DOUBLE           17.549959
   MODELCOEF       FLOAT     Array[5]
   FIXED           INT              0
   COEF            FLOAT     Array[5]
   FIRSTX          LONG               446
   LASTX           LONG              4095

FITCOEF gives the polynomial coefficients to get the Y-values for an order.  Y=poly(X,coef)
SIGCOEF are the uncertainties in FITCOEF.
RMS and CHISQ are for the polynomial fit to the flux-weighted Y-values of the order.
FIRSTX and LASTX give roughly the first/last X-vales for this order.
FWHM gives the FWHM of the order (at the central X-value) in the Y-dimension.
PEAKY, WTY and GAUSSY give the Y-value at the central X-value using various methods.
GASSY, HEIGHT, WFHM and GCOEF are from Gaussian-fitting (in the spatial/Y-dimension)
  at the central X-value.
At the end of the program it fits the FITCOEF parameters for all orders as a function of Y
  and tries to correct "outliers".  That's the MODELCOEF array.  If the original fitted
  parameters are considered "bad" and the model parameters are used then FIXED=1 else
  FIXED=0.
